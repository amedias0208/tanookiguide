# VetHub – A Personal Veterinary Learning Portal

## 📘 Overview
VetHub is a self-built HTML-based educational guide designed for veterinary technicians and assistants. It serves as a toolkit for learning diagnostic procedures, medications, equipment handling, and more.

## 🧠 Purpose
This project was developed to consolidate veterinary knowledge and serve as a self-teaching tool. Built from scratch while learning HTML, it reflects both my growth as a coder and my dedication to veterinary medicine.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- [Optional: JavaScript, if you add it later]
- Hosted on local server (Windows environment)

## 📂 Sections
- Diagnostics
- Medications
- Equipment
- Cytology
- Parasites
- [More to be added...]

## 🔐 Security
The guide is intended to run on a local environment. PIN-based access and future enhancements (like database or form integration) are planned.

## 🚧 In Progress
This project is actively being developed as I learn and improve. Next steps:
- Add interactivity via JavaScript
- Add a medication calculator
- Improve styling and navigation

## 📄 License
This is a personal learning project. All content is original unless noted. Please contact me for any use beyond educational purposes.
